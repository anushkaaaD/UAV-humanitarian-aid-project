# Project Management Plan for CAD Design of UAV for Humanitarian Aid

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project focused on creating a **comprehensive project management plan** for the Computer-Aided Design (CAD) of an **Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)** intended to deliver humanitarian aid in disaster-affected regions. The objective was to establish a clear roadmap for design, execution, and delivery while optimizing resources, minimizing delays, and adhering to budget constraints.

As the **Team Leader**, I oversaw project scheduling, resource allocation, cost analysis, and performance monitoring. The result was a structured, measurable plan with a **95% on-time task completion rate**, ensuring project alignment with strategic goals.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- Develop a realistic and achievable **project schedule**.
- Optimize **resource utilization** through capacity planning.
- Maintain **budget adherence** using S-curve monitoring.
- Track **key performance indicators (KPIs)** to ensure effective execution.
- Provide a project framework that could be replicated for similar humanitarian engineering initiatives.

---

## ðŸ›  Tools, Methodologies & Techniques
- **Microsoft Project** for scheduling, WBS, and Gantt charts.
- **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)** to break the project into manageable tasks.
- **Gantt Charts** for visual progress tracking.
- **Capacity Planning** to evaluate labor and resource availability.
- **Budget Analysis** with **S-Curve Monitoring** to track cost and progress alignment.
- **KPI Tracking** for:
  - Task completion rate
  - Budget adherence
  - Resource utilization efficiency

## ðŸ“Œ Key Contributions
- **Leadership & Coordination**  
  - Directed the project team, ensuring clear task assignments and accountability.
  - Maintained communication flow to ensure alignment across stakeholders.
  
- **Scheduling & Task Management**  
  - Developed a WBS to manage **20+ tasks** effectively.
  - Created and maintained a Gantt chart to visualize timelines and dependencies.
  - Monitored and adjusted schedules to ensure **95% on-time task completion**.

- **Budget & Resource Management**  
  - Conducted detailed **budget analysis** to prevent overspending.
  - Used **S-Curve analysis** to monitor cost performance and schedule variance.
  - Executed **capacity planning** to align resource availability with demand.

- **Performance Measurement**  
  - Defined KPIs for tracking efficiency and productivity.
  - Used data insights to make informed decisions during project execution.

## ðŸ“Š Outcomes & Results

**KPI Metrics:**
1. **Cost Performance Index (CPI):**  
   - Formula: `CPI = BCWP / ACWP = 14,936 / 15,635 = 0.96`  
   - Interpretation: Slightly over budget; every $1 spent yields $0.96 worth of work.

2. **Cost Variance (CV):**  
   - Formula: `CV = BCWP âˆ’ ACWP = 14,936 âˆ’ 15,635 = âˆ’699`  
   - Interpretation: Project exceeded budget by **$699**.

3. **Schedule Performance Index (SPI):**  
   - Formula: `SPI = BCWP / BCWS = 14,936 / 14,936 = 1.0`  
   - Interpretation: Project is exactly **on schedule**.

**Overall Impact:**
- Achieved **95% task completion on time** despite minor budget overrun.
- Delivered a fully structured and measurable project plan ready for execution.
- Provided a replicable project management framework for future humanitarian aid UAV projects.
